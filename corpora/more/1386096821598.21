Gataga has just notified TechCrunch of new functionality: - Gataga photo search (through Flickr) - Gataga Mobile Photo Search: The new functionality allows tag searches of flickr images. It works well, if a little slow (give them time, their server has been crushed with users). This is a great addition to the overall tagging meta-search, and hopefully will be integrated with normal searches in the near future. Our favorite test is to do a search on Selma Hayek, our favorite actress. Here’s the results (remember, just flickr for now): RSS feeds for searches are avaible. I would like to see the URL change to a set URI for the search as well, an easy fix (allows for posting to the search, emailing, etc.). Gataga Mobile: If you have a cell phone or mobile device that supports XHTML (WAP 2.0), you can get Gataga results on your mobile device (point your device to gataga.com/m. Technorati and Flickr tags only at the moment, but these guys get new functionality up fast – expect more soon. Screen shots here: Tags: gataga, tagging, web2.0, techcrunch, tags, search
