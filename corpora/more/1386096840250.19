I read about Orbâ€™s V4S product on Scobelizer and Skype Journal. V4S is a good, free tool for sending voicemails to Skype and Outlook contacts. V4S joins a whole bunch of products attacking the same or similar market (sending voicemails over the web): YackPack, Odeo Waxmail, vemail, Springdoo and even the humble slawesome.
