Meebo (original profile) is clearly going to be raising venture capital and/or be acquired in the very near future. I spoke with Founder Seth Sternberg yesterday about site growth and he revealed some impressive stats. Meebo is now averaging about 250,000 logins per day. On December 7, twelve weeks after launch, Meebo had 236,000 successful logins, 6,534,948 messages sent and approximately 13,069,896 total messages carried. Meebo is also asking users where they use the product, and why. The results: Where do you use meebo? Work: 59.7% School: 36.8% Home: 30.0% Internet Cafe: 7.3% Why do you use meebo? (free form answers coded) IM otherwise difficult / impossible to access: 33% Web IM is better than software IM: 18% meebo is easier: 11% I knew something was up because of the rabid comments I’ve been receiving on my original Meebo post – mostly students begging to find a way around school-imposed blocking of the meebo site. Here’s just one example: I am not able to use meebo. I want to access yahoo and hotmail mails.Can you gibe an alternative site through i can check my mails. I want it urgently. Thanks, Amit. I’ve seen passionate user comments like these before – talking about FaceBook. Meebo’s competitors include Gtalkr and e-messenger.net.
