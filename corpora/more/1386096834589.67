If you haven’t seen the Web2.0WorkGroup yet, check it out. My original post on it is here. We’ve added two new resources – Podtech.net and SolutionWatch. Podtech.net is a very popular podcast site hosted by John Furrier that is redefining corporate press practices. Recently, for instance, Yahoo gave Podtech an exclusive pre-announcement right to discuss their podcasting service last weekend. SolutionWatch, written by Brian Benzinger, focuses on new companies and products that are defining the web 2.0 landscape. Much like TechCrunch, Brian is helping to put perspective on how these products fit into the overall web ecosystem. Check out Podtech’s podcast discussion of the group here. Podtech.net and SolutionWatch join Dave Winer, TechCrunch, ReadWriteWeb, and WeBreakStuff as the early resources we’ve made available. More are coming soon.
