It looks like Redwood City-based Zoozio will be the next horse in the AJAX desktop race. We already have Protopage, Netvibes (our favorite) and (flash-based) Goowy. Oh yeah, and Google. Wait, Microsoft too. Thereâ€™s not much info on the site yet. I hope these guys have some interesting features if they want into this already crowded market. Thanks Steven for the tip. Pete Cashmore saw this yesterday as well.
