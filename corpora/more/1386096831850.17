Fred Wilson reports that Del.icio.us has extended its existing user-only search to everyone. Previously search was available only if you were logged in to your del.icio.us account. Check it out on any del.icio.us page, including here. Joshua Schachter has not yet written about this on the del.icio.us blog. Search functionality has also been expanded. In addition to showing your own results in addition to everyone else’s, you can search using “and” (such as apples and oranges) to drill down into more relevant results. Results are returned if the query term is contained withint the title of the bookmark and/or within tags. UPDATE: Per Joshua’s comments below (the founder of del.icio.us), del.icio.us comments are also searched. You can use “tag:tagname” to just search tags. If you are going to do multiple tag search, AND must be capitalized. I like the extended functionality a lot. David Weinberger also posts some very interesting del.icio.us stats.
