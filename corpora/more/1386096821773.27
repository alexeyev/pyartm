Service: Google Video Previous Posts: June 27, 2005. #1, #2 What’s new? Norwegian hacker cracks Google software A Norwegian guy took one day to crack Google’s new video viewer so that it plays video from any server, which is what VLC originally did. This is what Google should have done in the first place anyway. “The Norwegian who became a hacker hero for developing software to unlock copy-protection codes on DVD movies said he needed only one day to crack Google Inc.’s new video viewer. Jon Lech Johansen, also known as DVD Jon, posted software on his “So Sue Me” Web site that he says modifies the viewer so that it plays videos hosted on any server. The company’s Google Video Viewer, in turn, was modified from the free VLC media player to restrict it to playing video hosted on Google’s own servers. Google officials did not immediately return e-mail and phone messages left early Wednesday at its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters.” Links: GMSV on this John Battelle Tags: googlevideo, vlc, web2.0, techcrunch, google
