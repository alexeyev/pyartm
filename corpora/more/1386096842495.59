37 Signalsâ€™ announced a couple of new features yesterday and today for their popular (100,000 users claimed on home page) and useful Basecamp project management product. First, Basecamp now hosts files directly on their servers without the need to set up your own FTP server. Files as large as 20 mb can be uploaded. Second, Basecamp has created a basic affiliate program. If an affiliate pushes new paying members to Basecamp, the user gets credits against their Basecamp fees.
