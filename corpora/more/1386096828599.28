Mash-ups, or the use of distinctive services for the creation of new and interesting applications, are one of the most interesting concepts behind the Web 2.0 phenomenon. Here on Techcrunch, we’re always up for the challenge of talking about innovation with services and apps, so we have decided to start covering Mash-ups more frequently. What this means is that besides the profiles and articles you’re already used to reading on the site, we’ll be talking about the cool stuff people are building by combining the platforms companies like Google, Yahoo, Amazon, Ebay and everyone else are setting up. This is a fascinating field, in a quite fascinating era for computing. This being said, and since we are always up to see what our readers are doing, feel free to send in comments or emails about what you find interesting about the Web 2.0, mashups, platform services or anything you believe fits on Techcrunch. We’re ready to listen to what you have to say, and we’re definitely up to seeing what cool projects and products you are all working on.
