Company: zvents Launched: Today Previous Profile: September 26, 2005 Location: Menlo Park, CA The zvents team took the wrapper off their social event manager/calendar today. The timing of the announcement couldnâ€™t be better, as Upcoming.org (a competitor) announced its acquisition by Yahoo yesterday. Ethan Stock posted about the launch on the zvents blog. Key features include best of breed event search, tagging of events, easy blogging and blog/website widgets to promote your event. zvents uses ajax intelligently and the site feels very stable. Zvents is also opening up a number of APIs to grab their data, encouraging mashups. We applaud them and look forward to developments.
