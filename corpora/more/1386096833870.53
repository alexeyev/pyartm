Wink is a very interesting new search site that combines traditional search results with del.icio.us and other user generated metadata. We profiled Wink on October 12, 2005 and Michael Tanne, the CEO, gave a demo at our party last week. Wink was also one of the sponsors of our party. Wink is in private beta right now and are dripping in new users a few at a time to test the service. Thousands of people have been waiting weeks to get in. As part of their sponsorship of our party, Wink has agreed to guarantee immediate access to the first 100 people who request a beta account at Wink and write “techcruncher” in the note section. This process is automated – if you don’t receive an immediate invitation you either misspelled “techcruncher” or 100 people have already requested an invite with the code. If you aren’t one of the first 100, they will still make an effort to get you to the top of the list. Michael has requested that I stress that beta testers should be willing to spend some time helping them build out the service. You can do that by tagging results, syncing with your del.icio.us tags, creating search sets and, generally, performing a lot of searches.
