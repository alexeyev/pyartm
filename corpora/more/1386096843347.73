The Web 2.0 WorkGroup continues its expansion with the addition of three awesome new bloggers – Ben Barren, Stowe Boyd and Steve Rubel. Robert Scoble joined last week. It’s becoming an increasingly fun place to hang out, even if two of our members lost their minds earlier this week (temporarily I hope). What I’m really looking forward to is seeing if Ben Barren writes emails the same way he writes his blog posts (our email list is quite active).
