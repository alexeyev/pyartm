The founders of Jux2, a great metasearch engine, put it up for sale on ebay yesterday. John Battelle wrote about this yesterday as well. Aaref Hilaly, one of the founders (and a friend) emailed to tell me about it, saying that the founders just don’t have enough time to put into the project and deal with growth. Starting price? $0.01, with no reserve. Current price? $26,100 with 7 days left. Jux2 won Search Engine Watch’s best metadata search engine award earlier this year. It’s an excellent way to view the big search engine results side-be-side, and has a very clean and usable interface.
