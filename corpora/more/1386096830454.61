One of the great features of Measure Map (profiled here and here) is that it gives you real time stats on almost every aspect of your blog. One of the features I like to check out every once in a while is “Browsers your visitors used today”. Today I noticed that 69% of TechCrunch visitors use Firefox, whereas only 16% used Internet Explorer and 14% used Safari. These numbers vary a bit from day to day, but Firefox always has a commanding lead. Measure Map is still in closed beta but has given me permission to post the image below, grabbed earlier today.
