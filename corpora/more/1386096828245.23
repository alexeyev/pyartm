Peter Van Dijck, author of one of my favourite books on IA (That many of you will probably like: Information Architecture for Designers), has launched Mefeedia some time ago, and is getting rave reviews about his video aggregator. In fact, the reviews have been so great that it is a part of the “Best of the Web” by BusinessWeek’s editor. If you haven’t seen Mefeedia yet, here’s what they have to say about themselves: Mefeedia is an aggregator, a video feedreader. It is a place to watch videobloggers. Before you ask: we don’t host the videos. We just point to them. There is a ton of commercial video on the web. Porn, the late show, you name it. Even though you can find some of that on me-tv, we’re really about real video created by real people. So we focus our functionality on that. We try to make it easier to tell your story, share your worldview, and find others who are telling their stories. Some people have mixed feelings about videoblogging. While some say it will never pick up, others say it’s going to be huge by the end of the year. Personally, I believe it is a fascinating area, and anything that gives more power for people to publish their own video/audio/text materials in a decentralized way is a great thing. We’ll see where it goes. For now, congratulations goes out to Mefeedia for the pick.
