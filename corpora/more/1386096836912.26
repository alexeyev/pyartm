Riya is holding its launch party here at the TechCrunch house next Friday, November 18, 2005. If you are in the area, make sure to drop by. Our last party/meetup was a blowout and I expect this one to be even bigger. Lots to eat and drink, and Riya will be giving a very cool presentation. The wiki for the party is here. Signup page and list of current attendees is here. Please RSVP on this page so that we know how many people will be attending. On a side note, Riya is on a tear right now. People are loving their software â€“ check out the Wired article on them by Kathleen Craig. Our profile is here. Date: November 18, 2005 Time: 7-11 pm Place: 44 James Avenue, Atherton, CA Wiki: Here RSVP: Here
