Web 2.0 Weekly Wrapup July 31 – August 6 A lot happened in our web 2.0 world this last week. Lots of new data was published by Dave Sifry and Technorati, additional work was done on the definition of â€œweb 2.0″, as well as lots of other developments (see below for all). I was forced to cut some things from the wrapup this week because otherwise it would have simply been too long otherwise. For instance, I had the following items in my notes, but they have been scrapped: Robert Scoble stopped blogging, but heâ€™s back now. Good. Google takes CNET out at the knees (especially Jeremy Zawodnyâ€™s reaction) Everyone was talking about the A List of bloggers last week, but I agree with Fred Wilson and Dave Winer on this one. Much to Dells chagrin, “getting dellâ€™d” is the new phrase to use when companies are getting trashed by customers. Before I get into the main items, I want to point to a new blog I read (I do not know the blogger but I have pointed to it once or twice) that had a post last week entitled â€œItâ€™s lonely starting a blog“. The post is self explanatory. Since even the Giants of our industry every once in a while reach out to their readers to make sure they are still there, I ask those of you who are so inclined to reach out and leave a comment on this blog. This isn’t pity, or charity. It’s simply helping one blogger get over that initial hurdle. I also want to thank Jeff Jarvis. Ok, back to business. This week’s wrapup: 1. TechCrunch Profiles This Week GmailDrive, BlinkList, IceRocket (name change), TalkDigger, XMHD, Jyve, Browster, MSN Start.com, Collaborative Rank, Indeed, Simply Hired, IceRocket (Link Tracker), Chalk, Yorz, AttentionTrust, Blinksale 2. Technorati update on the “State of the Blogosphere” Technorati updated their March data last week with new stats, and the blogosphere’s growth certainly doesn’t seem to have peaked yet. We (as in “we the blogosphere”) are averaging about 1,000,000 new posts per day, even on slow news days. Six months ago it was less than 200,000/day. And the total number of blogs continues to double approximately every five months. This information is simply staggering, even as we are becoming somewhat deaf to new staggering information. Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 3. Take a stroll down memory lane with CNET CNET names the “Top 10 dot-com flops“. I knew and loved most of these companies, and remember those lovely days when just about any idea could get funded. Yes, we all burned through money on stupid things like television ads (too bad Purple Cow hadn’t been written yet or we’d know better) and million dollar parties, but at least it was a learning experience, right? And dammit, we LOVED Webvan. We really, really loved them. 4. Defining Web 2.0 Doc Searls and Martin at Mediatope added to Richard MacManus’ worthy efforts to define Web 2.0 earlier this year (with further thoughts by Richard as well). A separate thread, started by Tim Bray and countered by Tim O’Reilly, argues whether or not Web 2.0 is a meme or a faux-meme. I’m not smart enough to comment on this – I had to look up what meme meant on Google just to follow the conversation. I will say this though. Those of us that spend all day, every day, thinking about Web 2.0 aren’t able to define it in a single sentence. We know its important, and it’s happening right now, but we just aren’t quite able to verbalize it. Yet. 5. Fred Wilson writes a(nother) Masterpiece When Fred Wilson writes, thousands of people eagerly consume it. He’s smart and he doesn’t go on and on – he gets to his point. His post “Posting, Subscribing, and Tagging” is one of his best essays so far. I like to keep things simple. And to me blogging is about three things: Posting, Subscribing, and Tagging. These are the three essential and fundamental functions and they are the building blocks for all the different kinds of blogging. Blogging is not limited to posting a short blast of text into Blogger, Typepad, WordPress, or Live Journal. Blogging is way bigger than that. Fred also stresses that we are just getting started, and that the best stuff is yet to come. We agree. Additional Links: Matt McAlister, Hyku, Gaping Void, Charbuck.com 6. The Dark Side of Tags The problem with publisher tagging is that it is begging for spam. And it’s starting to appear. See Om Malik and Michael Parekh on this topic. 7. Report on Social Networks Library Stuff tipped us off to a new report by Wildbit on social networks. It’s worth the read – particuarly if you are going to start a new one. 8. WikiMania!!! Wikimania was held in Frankfurt on August 4-8, 2005. Lots of bloggers attended and, you guessed it, blogged. I would very much have liked to attend.

Blog Software Reviewed Bill Machrone looks at blogging software, and gives appropriate kudos to Moveable Type. I don’t disagree with the article, but I will say this. Blogging software sucks. And there is huge room for improvement. When my dad can publish a professional looking and customizable blog without knowing a thing about html or CSS or RSS or Atom or categories or tags or anything else, then talk to me about how great blogging software is. Sorry folks, it’s not even close to time to start patting ourselves on the back yet. Somebody needs to do for blogging what Blinksale (profile) did for invoices. Then we’ll be somewhere. Give me a user interface with Ajax! If you have a newsletter, a club or organization site, or an online publication for a niche audience, though, blog software is just about perfect. That’s what I needed for a site I wanted to build: something with built-in reader commentary, RSS syndication, template-based article entry, and the ability to make style changes without having to find and replace across every HTML page.
