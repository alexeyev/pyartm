Company: Google (Wallet) What is it? This hasn’t launched yet, but there is some buzz around the blogosphere (and the Wall Street Journal) that Google is planning on launching a competing payment service to PayPal. Is this Web 2.0? I think so. If its p2p, which I imagine it would be, then it certainly is. From the WSJ article: “For Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., a payment service could represent a significant expansion beyond online advertising, which generated 99 percent of its $3.2 billion in revenue last year, the Journal said. Online-payment providers typically take a commission on each transaction.” Google has a hill to climb – paypal has 72 million users (PayPal accounted for $233.1 million, or 23 percent, of eBayâ€™s revenue during the first quarter). However, they’ve done this before with search (v. everyone), advertising (v. overture) and email, although not with a social network (see orkut – when’s the last time you logged in?) Gary Price noted that the company “Google Payment Corporation” was created by Google a couple of months ago: “I did a bit of research (love that deep web (-:) after reading the article and discovered that two months ago Google filed the paperwork with the California Secretary of State and formed the Google Payment Corporation. Interesting.” Gary also noted that someone registered “googlewallet.com“. More on this as it develops.
