Company: Listal Launched: August 29, 2005? (based on earliest date in forum) Creator: Tom Mascord Location: UK (based on listal.com whois information) Overview Listal is a very early beta product that allows you to catalog, tag and share your physical media. At this point it is free. While functionality is currently limited (heck, it’s only a few days old), the site clearly anticipates upcoming features and it looks like it can become quite useful. Since there are limited solutions for organizing physical media using your computer, I like where this is going. Once you’ve registered, you can tell it the books, music, movies and games (physical media) you own. There is also a nice ajax interface to tag items and rate them. Your listal stuff is public – ours is at techcrunch.listal.com. For now, there is no way to make any part of the list private. Features Features include: Add products via search, amazon ASIN number or ISBN (for books) Group items with custom themed lists Tag items Rate Items Add Wanted Items Write and read reviews of items Delicious Monster I also want to mention a wonderful and similar product called Delicious Monster (Mac-only and not browser-based, you have to download software). In addition to an award winning design, DM also allows users to simply point a digital video camera at any bar code and capture the media information without typing a single thing in. Delicious Monster launched in November 2004 and racked up sales of $250k in its first month (the product is $40). It is also (or was) headquarted in a Seattle coffee house. If Listal can become as good as Delicious Monster, they’ll have something.
