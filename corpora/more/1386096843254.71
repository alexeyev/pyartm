Getting on to the home page of Digg (profile) sends a site a lot of traffic, and some folks will do just about anything for traffic. I know a lot of people who claim to have multiple Digg accounts to give their posts a lift, but it appears that the practice has become more…professional recently. Richard MacManus has done some research on the issue and posts on his findings. Bottom line – at least for now, gaming Digg is exceptionally easy.
