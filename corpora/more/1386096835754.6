Wow, am I excited this morning to see Microsoft announce Simple Sharing Extensions (SSE), which turns RSS bidirectional and which is released under the Creative Commons License. I wrote more about this at CrunchNotes, but I want to mention it here because this is an incredibly important technology that will allow entirely new classes of companies to be built. Dave Winerâ€˜s excited too.
