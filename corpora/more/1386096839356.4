Meebo confirmed the rumor that they have received funding from Sequoia Capital on their blog. Congratulations to everyone involved. No real details yet, but I’m hearing that the pre-money valuation was $9 million, not $10 million as I originaly reported. I assume the investment was in the $3 – $4m range.
