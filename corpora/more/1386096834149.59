We are proud to annouce the sponsors of the third TechCrunch party this weekend. Thank You: Edgeio, Flock, Goowy, Loomia, Pandora, Real Travel, Shasta Ventures, Simply Hired, Wink, Zazzle. If you plan on attending, please sign up on the Wiki. Demos start at 6 pm sharp. We are going to reduce the demo time to 15 minutes to get more companies in. At 7 pm we’ll take a 15-20 minute break for toasts and a keynote by Dave Winer. I’m pretty fired up about these demos. Some of the companies, like Sphere (and to some extent Flock), will be showing their stuff in public for the first time ever.
