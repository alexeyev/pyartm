There’s a ton of podcasting news coming out. I’ll profile a couple of other companies tomorrow but I thought it was worth mentioning that BackBeat Media launched a podcast network today with three initial participants – Coverville, Evil Genius Chronicles and The Mac Observer’s Mac Geek Gab. My understanding is that Backbeat will provide advertising sponsorships and some operational support to participating podcasters. Press release is here.
