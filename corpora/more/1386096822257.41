Company: Technorati Technorati fully launched their new beta with a slightly different look than the beta announced 10 days ago (profile here). Complete list of new features can be seen here (Dave Sifry’s blog) and at the new Technorati corporate Blog (link). I saw this earlier at the technorati site, and saw this post at The Blog Herald. The new site is great, adds lots of new features and we look forward to future improvements. It’s hard to say that I like it more or less than the “old” technorati – things grow on you and it takes time for new stuff to settle. But so far, I like it and the new feature set is strong.
