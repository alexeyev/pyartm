Gawker continues to drive its busines forward amidst rumors of an acquisition in the works with the New York Times. In addition to their recent deal to promote their content within Yahoo, Gawker today announced the launch of its newest blog, The Consumerist, a humorous slant on today’s consumptive world: “We here at Gawker Media love to spend our money, but we hate being treated like cattle while we do it. And so our big happy family is proud to announce the birth of our latest site: Consumerist, our answer to the utter fuckitude of modern capitalism.” Edited by Joel Johnson, who formerly wrote Gizmodo, The Consumerist is off to a strong start with posts such as “Gay Wallet Follies” and “Lenovo’s Free Thinkpad Battery Bait and Switch“. The Consumerist has a full, ad supported feed and a partial, no ads feed.
