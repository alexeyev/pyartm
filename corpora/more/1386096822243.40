Editorâ€™s Note: This is an update from an earlier post we made today. The service is now live. Service: Google Video Previous Profile: June 27, 2005. Link What is it? The service is now live. To use it, you must download their VLC client (about 1 mb) here. Once it is installed, you can search for videos (link), and videos that have an arrow icon next to them (see screen shots below) can be viewed by clicking on the icon. Non-free videos will eventually be integrated with the Google Payment Service (see profile here). A sample search with videos is here. It works well, with little download time and few stops/starts with standard broadband. Uploading videos is a separate process.
