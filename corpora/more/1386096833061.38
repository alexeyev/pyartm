Microsoft’s new ajax Hotmail client, called Kahuna, is massively expanding its beta group today, to approximatley 200,000 users. Until today the beta was extremely difficult to get into, frustrating some hotmail users. We’ve been beta testing Kahuna for a few weeks. It is a big improvement on the old Hotmail interface, using ajax to provide a much more Outlook-like email experience. Features include a three-pane view and drag and drop functionality to folders, etc. We previously wrote about Kahuna on August 16, 2005 and August 24, 2005.
