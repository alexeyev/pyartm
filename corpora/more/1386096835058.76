Company: PreviewSeek Launched: August 2005 Status: Angel Funding Location: London, UK PreviewSeek is a new London-based search engine created by Chris Hong that is very quietly impressing people with a number of innovating features. Basic search results are great but nothing to get overly excited about. The useful features include disambiguation of queries (are you searching for “apple” the fruit, or “apple” the computer”?), preview of search pages (think Browster), and better refining of searches. Understanding Your Query PreviewSeek does a good job at attempting to determine meaning from a query. Type in “Java” and you get a result set with a numer of options for the query, including the island, the programming language, and even the coffee. Preview Results This is my favorite feature. PreviewSeek allows you to preview search results in much the same way as Browster (our profile), except without the download and the ads. It’s a great way quickly scan results without actually clicking away from previewseek. Search Refinement For any given query PreviewSeek will suggest a number of refinement options on the left sidebar, which greatly assist in drilling down on a particular search.
