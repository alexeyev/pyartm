Blog Network Watch has a list of the most popular blog networks, based on various metrics from Technorati, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft. I’m happy to note that our very own Web 2.0 Workgroup, which is a loose affiliation of top blogs, is No. 4 on the list behind Gawker, Pajamas Media and Weblogs, Inc. Of course, it’s nice to have heavy hitters like Dave Winer to anchor things.
