Thank you to everyone who attended our meetup/bbq last night in Atherton. We are definitely going to do this at least monthly, and we had a number of offers for corporate sponsorships last night to cover food, drinks, etc. in the future. If you have any pictures from last night, please upload them to the wiki picture area (or place a link to buzznet or flickr or wherever you’ve posted them). Also, I see posts by Tara, Ethan, Esteban, Justin Smith, Kevin, Chris Heuer, Ho John Lee, and Saha on the meetup. Thanks for writing! Tara is also tagging her flickr pictures of the event with the tag “techcrunchbbq”. Good idea. I’ll do the same. Pictures: .
