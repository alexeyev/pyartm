Company: Digg Previous Profile: June 18, 2005 Digg 2.0 Launched: 5 hours ago (July 10, 2005) What is it? See our previous profile on Digg for a description of its functionality. Its a very useful news site that leverages user submissions and “diggs” of stories to promote content higher in various categories and the home page. Digg released version 2.0 a few hours ago. New look and feel and expanded functionality. In their own words, “Tons of new features, and a few bugs too Please submit any bugs you find by clicking on “report a website bug” in the lower right hand corner. We will do our best to get them fixed as soon as possible. Thanks and enjoy! (note: minimalist design coming in v2.1)ï¿½” Link One nice feature we’ve noticed is the ability to add Digg stories to your own homepage – cool widget.
