We note, however, that criticism is already being throw their way. Roland Tanglao laments Blogtronix’s choice of the .NET platform over open source solutions: Pure FUD. Perhaps Vassil doesn’t realize that 1000s of companies are happily using LAMP and other open source solutions for their blogging and business networking needs without fearing the integration bogeyman. In 1999, companies were wary of using open source, in 2005 it’s a no brainer. I see Roland’s point, although a lot of companies out there love .NET and may embrace this solution simply because it will (hopefully) integrate seemlessly with their current IT platform. A boring, but secure, solution may be just what they want.
