Flickr announced that they are now supporting photo printing. They are giving away 10 free 4×6 prints to each user to start. Only people with U.S. credit card addresses can participate for now. Photos can be delivered, or picked up at any Target store with one hour processing. The costs are very reasonable, too. See the FAQs. On a separate note, I’ve been using the Flickr Uploader recently to upload photos. I know its been around for a while, but it sure does make uploading pictures (and tagging them) a lot easier. By the way, take the “beta” off the logo, guys. You’ve arrived.
