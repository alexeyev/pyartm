A couple of days ago I wrote an editorial on our focus in mash-ups, and how we were going to start posting the ones we find the most interesting. So to kick things off, here’s a great project that mashes Demographics information with Google Maps creating an extremely interesting result. AnalyGIS, in partnership with SRC, has developed a proof-of-concept application that combines the features of SRC’s Allocate demographics engine and Google Maps. Check it out in action by clicking this link. More information is available at AnalyGISs site, but the interesting thing to note is how these mash-ups are great information visualization techniques built around services that otherwise wouldn’t have that ability.
