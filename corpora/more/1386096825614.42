Company: Technorati Previous Post: June 20, 2005 Technorati Aquisition Rumors A post today by B.L. Ochman ignited rumors that Technorati may be acquired in the near future: Technorati About to Be Sold Here’s a tip I was given this morning from a venture capitalist who is “heavily invested” in the blogosphere: Technorati is about to be sold to a large search engine company. The deal should go down in about a week. My bet is on Yahoo! Where’s yours? True? Wild speculation? We have no idea. Sure are a lot of acquisition rumors this week though. Is this story (“Murdoch is Set to Buy a Search Company”) related? It looks like we’re not the only ones seeing the connection. Update: Jeff Jarvis says “Iâ€™m seeing rumblings that itâ€™s not true.” Additional Links: Chris Abraham, LicensetoRoam, Arieanna Foley, Tris Hussey
