Pandora just stopped playing music. I went to their site and saw this message: We apologize for the inconvenience… After a successful preview period, Pandora will be open to the public starting very soon. We’re updating our systems to support the full public version. Please check back tomorrow… and enjoy the music! By the time I wake up tomorrow I expect Pandora will be fully live. We posted a profile of Pandora here, and wrote about their upcoming launch here. Glad to see them finally go live, sad to have to start paying. Robert Scoble continues to love Pandora too. They passed his “seven-day” test and he’s still using it. Steve Gillmor, you are going to lose that bet with Robert and me.
