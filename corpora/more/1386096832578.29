Qumana is an excellent wysiwyg online/offline tool for editing blogs. We’ve written about Qumana before and described their service, which is completely free. Yesterday Qumana launched v 2.0 of their product. The primary feature addition is the ability to easily, very easily, add pay-per-click ads directly into blog posts. Ads can be positioned anywhere, and there are a couple of formatting options to choose from (see arrows in screen shot below). Revenues are split 50/50 between Qumana and the publisher. Ads are keyword driven based on tags you set for the post, and flow into RSS without any problems. Each Ad is tracked by keyword and clicks. Ads can also be previewed before final posting. The publisher has the flexibility to add as many or as few ads as he or she desires. There are additional new features as well, including improved old post edits, better drag and drop tools, and better integration with wordpress and blogger. This is the best tool I’ve seen for small (and large) bloggers to easily include ads in posts.
