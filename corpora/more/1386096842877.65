Consumating, a dating site with tagging that I profiled in August, has been acquired by CNet. Congratulations to both founders. I didn’t know that Adaptive Path had helped design Consumating until reading about it on Alexander Muse’s blog today. I am increasingly impressed by the value that AP adds to companies that work with them.
