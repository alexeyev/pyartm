This mashup certainly caught my eye – The Beer Hunter. Unlike California, where you can buy alcohol just about anywhere until 2 am, parts of Canada have very restrictive alcohol laws – its hard to find a place to buy it, and the hours of operation are erratic. I know this because I lived in Ottawa a couple of years ago. I fondly remember the fascist-like Liquor Control Board of Ontario and it’s near-overwhelming control over alcohol in Ontario, Canada. Well, Janis Mussat is helping. She’s created a mashup of Google maps and local alcohol outlet hours of operation. If you live in Ontario, this just may become your home page.
