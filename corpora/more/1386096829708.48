The Katrina situation is just too horrible. I can’t get passionate about tech when a million people’s homes have been destroyed, there are dead bodies in the streets of New Orleans, our military is pointing their guns at people who just want water, and entire cities have been wiped out. Forget TechCrunch. Read MetroBlogging New Orleans and Slidell and, if you can, and donate to the Red Cross.
