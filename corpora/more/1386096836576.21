Songbird replaced its landing page with a blog and is giving more information on the product (I had next to no details for my original Songbird post earlier this month). The site now has additional screenshots and a few posts that begin to talk about the product. I am alpha testing Songbird now and am very impressed, even though they say it is only 30% done (as of November 18). They have asked me not to blog about non public information yet, and I won’t. One thing to clear up is that Songbird is not an online application – it is (among other things) a next generation media player. And it is absolutely turning my head around in the way I think about certain things. They’ll be pushing a preview release in December.
