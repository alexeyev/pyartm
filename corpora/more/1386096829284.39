New day, new (notorious) mash-up envolving Google Maps. Placeopedia is a great mash-up that combines Google Maps with Wikipedia, creating a visual representation of topics by place – thus allowing you to search for articles that relate to a certain location in a map. Placeopedia tackles the problem with Wikipedia of not having a visual guide to where (in a map) articles refer to. Naturally, it doesn’t make sense to localize every single article, but where correctly used, this may become an extremely powerful (and fun) tool.
