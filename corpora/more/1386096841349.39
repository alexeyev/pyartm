The PostSecret book that I ordered back in October arrived from Amazon. I spent some time going through it last night and I really like it. PostSecret is one of the more interesting Web 2.0 companies (if you can call it a company). It certainly creates conversation, evokes emotion, and merges the online and offline worlds beautifully. If you’d like to buy the book, it is available at Amazon. And speaking of books, check out Om’s free “best of” ebook. Wow, great design by Arno Ghelfi.
