The guys at Odeo have just launched a Dashboard widget for mac users who want to listen to their podcasts straight from their desktop. Due to its nature it is OSX Tiger only – even though with Yahoo Widgets it shouldn’t be much work to have something going for Windows too – but if you run it on your machine, make sure you check it out. It’s always good to see companies embrace new capabilities of operating systems and being creative with them. Also, it is great to see the Odeo guys aren’t sitting down and keep working on cool stuff that us podcasting aficionados can use. Great!
