Company: Browster Previous Profiles: July 13, 2005 & August 3, 2005 Scott Milener, the CEO of Browster, just left a very interesting comment on our last Browster posting. After supporting Firefox for only a couple of weeks (actually, about a week), it accounts for 1/3 of total downloads: thanks for posting and for the kind words about Browster. Weâ€™re really happy to be supporting Firefox. Weâ€™re now getting requests for Browstr on all platforms and all browsers – lots to do! interestingly our Firefox install numbers are already 1/3 of our installs (thousands per day). itâ€™s that kind of acceptance that helps drive the Firefox community and companies like ours to support the platform. please drop me a line with any thoughts about improvements or any other ideas. thx Scott Milener CEO Browster
