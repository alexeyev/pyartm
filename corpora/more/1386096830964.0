Edgeio is a company that Keith Teare, Vidar Hokstad, Matt Kaufman, Fred Oliveira and I have been working on for most of this year. It willl be launching in the near future. If you’d like to be notified of the launch, please give us your email on the temporary landing page. Edgeio will give you the ability to do new and (we think) really exciting things with your blog. If you have a weblog and you’d like to be part of early testing, there is a field for giving us your blog address as well. Edgeio will also have its own blog soon with more details.
