Chris Heur has organized a BrainJam meetup in San Francisco this Friday, October 7 from 1-5 pm. The nascent wiki is here. Web 2.0 ends at 5 on Friday, so we’ll drop by for the “after party” that begins at 5:30. The cost? $2.80. Since I spent $2k for Web 2.0, this dollar-cost-averages down my per-event cost for the week to about $1k. Nice.
