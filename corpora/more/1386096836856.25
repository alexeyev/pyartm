Topix.net added 15,000 top blogs into its news engine today. Unlike Yahoo, which took the step of integrating blog search results into the news area but pushed them off to the side, Topix has integrated blog posts into results in the same manner as their other 12,000 news feeds. The Topix blog post announcing the addition gives great information on how they chose the 15,000 feeds, and how blog coverage differs from traditional news coverage. Good stuff. Iâ€™m really happy to see this.
