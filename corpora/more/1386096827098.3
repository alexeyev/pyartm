We had a TechCrunch BBQ tonight in Atherton, California. It started off as an informal get together but ended up with quite a few web 2.0 entrepreneurs and bloggers. Entertainment included Costco hamburgers and many bottles of good California wine. Attendees included Jeff Clavier, Clarence Wooten, Chad Hurley, Michael Duran, Nivi, Frederico Oliveira, Daniel Gould & Brian Norgard (cool new startup to come soon), Tim Kay, Keith Teare, Drew Dunlevie and others. Discussion ranged from Marx v. Reality to what’s new in Web 2.0. We’re looking forward to doing this every week and inviting more entrepreneurs. Thanks everyone for attending.
