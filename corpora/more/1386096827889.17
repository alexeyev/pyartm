Somebody pointed out to me today that Tony Guntharp, a senior software engineer at Feedster (previous Feedster profile here), wrote this on his blog today: Work So I’ve been busting my ass the past few weeks getting ready for a new feature launch for work. I’ll post more updates more frequently after the 6th including screenshots and thoughts from World of Warcraft. Could be nothing, could be something. Email to Tony went unanswered, although it’s only been a few hours. This could also be about World of Warcraft – the post isn’t totally clear. Nothing on Scott Rafer’s Feedster Blog as of 9 pm PST on 9/6/05.
