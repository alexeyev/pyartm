Feedburner released important statistics on their service yesterday. If you are unfamiliar with Feedburner, check out our original profile. The graphs show total feeds managed by feedburner and total subscribers to those feeds. Both show hockey-stick like growth that looks similar to data released by Technorati (see item no. 2 in a past TechCrunch weekly summary). I believe that these stats are very relevant to the blogospere in general. We are in a steadily increasing tide, that is increasing at an increasing rate. All boats are rising. Feedburner now manages about 100,000 feeds and about 4.3 million people subscribe to those feeds. The growth rates are obvious: Paul Kedrosky notes that the number of feed subscribers is doubling approximately every 60 days. What I’d like to know is what percentage pay the $5 per month for the Pro product. If it’s around 5% (that’s my guess), then FeedBurner revenues (not including advertising) would be about $300,000 or so annualized. The only thing left to ask is, do you have your FeedBurner sticker yet? I do. We’ve previously written about Feedburner on September 7, 2005, July 15, 2005, July 4, 2005 and June 14, 2005.
