I’m a little late writing about this, but TalkDigger 2.0, which launched a week and a half ago, has really evolved since the original version that I wrote about back in July. TalkDigger queries major blog (and other) search engines on a given URL and returns relevant results. Since all of the search engines vary in their results, this is the quickest way to see everything. Enhancements include more search results, more search engines, pagerank for each result, and more. I found an interesting RSS feature in the tools section, for example. And, the results UI is much more user friendly and looks like normal search results. Frédérick Giasson, the creator of TalkDigger, give a full feature overview on his blog.
