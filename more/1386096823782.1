Company: IceRocket (Link Tracker) Previous Profiles: July 29, 2005, July 31, 2005 What’s New? IceRocket released their Link Tracker tool for website owners. There are a couple of fairly simple integration options. This tool will insert a link at the bottom of each of your posts. The link will be to an IceRocket page that shows all posts and websites linking to your post’s URI. Along with comments, trackbacks and pingbacks, this is a nice way for blogs to keep a conversation going. Very nifty.
