Tagalag is a service that lets you tag people, via their email address. It’s not a “tribute” site like 43 people, because only people who know a person’s email address can add tags for that person. If you create a profile you can add personal and geographical information about yourself. I don’t know if Tagalag is onto a viable business model, but I like the idea of tagging people. This could become interesting as it evolves.
