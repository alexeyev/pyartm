Company: ufeed Launched: June 2005 What is it? ufeed aggregates posts from your blog, posts to delicious and pictures posted to flickr into a single web page that they host, with an RSS feed. The service is associated with SemSym. It’s pretty raw right now, but functional, and new features are promised. You can use their service without registering, although registration allows a number of additional benefits: The service is easy to set up and both the registered and unregistered versions are free. I’ve created a techcrunch account and have aggregated the posts/feeds – you can see it at ufeed.semsym.com/feeds/techcrunch/. This is coolish, but needs some UI work and added features to become really useful.
