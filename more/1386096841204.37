Jotspot continues to roll out interesting, easy to use wiki products. I wrote about JotSpot Live back in September. This week they released JotSpot Tracker, a spreadsheet wiki that allows users to both import and export excel spreadsheets. As more office applications move online, JotSpot Tracker joins NumSum and the open-source TrimSpreadsheet in the spreadsheet space. While Jotspot Tracker is clearly the most polished of the three, funcionality is very limited and the small visable area leaves a lot to be desired. Nonetheless, this is an excellent way to collaborate on simpler, smaller spreadsheets and bypass the hassle of email and chaotic version numbers. And the inport function was flawless.
