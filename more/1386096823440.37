Company: Simpy Previous Profiles: July 18, 2005 What’s New? Simpy is a social bookmarking service that can be compared to Shadows, del.icio.us, Furl, Yahoo My Web 2.0 and others. Simpy released new features today, including - full text search of bookmarked sites - a tag cloud of your bookmarks - remove, rename, split, and merge tags From Otis on the Simpy Blog: “The Release Log has the details, but in short, I am happy to announce that the new Simpy release is out! The most notable features concern searching and tagging. The full-text search is back! Not only can you full-text search your own bookmarks, but you can also full-text search any other Simpy user’s public bookmarks. In my opinion, this is big and useful. Browsing by tags is nice, but is also limiting. Full-text search can do more, and since Simpy supports fielded search, you can always emulate tag search with queries like tags:foo (more info is in the FAQ). You can see your Tag Cloud now (just use the “tags” link in the nav bar at the top of Simpy pages). A Tag Cloud is a more visual representation of your tags and their usage distribution. Along with the Tag Cloud come the 4 new Tag functions: remove, rename, split, and merge. These 4 functions will let you mess with your tags to your heart’s content. If they are not enough, I’m all ears.” Release Notes are here. These are useful additional features. I really like seeing data in a tag cloud format for some reason – I’d love it if the RSS aggregators showed new unread content in this format – it would make it much easier to quickly get to the content I want to read. I also have to say that I was blown away by the Shadows “Shadow Page” idea – simple yet very, very useful, and I would like to see simpy and others consider this idea.
