I just heard about songbird, which should be launching in December. I have very little information on it currently. Whatever it is (client? Web app?), it looks like a music/podcast player of some sort and itâ€™s certainly visually appealing. More (perhaps) on this later. You can sign up for Songbird announcements here.
