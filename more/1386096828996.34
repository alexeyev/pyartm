Company: Del.icio.us Previous Posts: August 15, 2005, July 10, 2005 and June 16, 2005 This is definitely filed under the rumor category, but two people have separately pointed out to me a public del.icio.us link by Fred Wilson (user’s links are posted under the URL del.icio.us/[username]). Fred links to a del.icio.us toolbar Firefox Extension called Very Delicious (see below). In the notes section, he writes “what do we think of this one? i might try it out unless all this will be in our toolbar” (emphasis added). Fred’s fund, Union Square Ventures, is an investor in Del.icio.us. The link suggests, therefore, that del.icio.us will be coming out with their own toolbar. Now Since Fred knows that many people monitor his delicious links, it makes you wonder if he’s just messing around, and/or is using this as a way to let the market know that the product is coming. Either way, it’ll be a toolbar worth having and I can’t wait until Joshua releases it. Lots of other rumors of new delicious features coming soon. I’m under super double secret NDA on those. Update: Through Solution Watch, I now know that del.icio.us alread has a preliminary and rudimentary toolbar out. New version may be coming out soon?
