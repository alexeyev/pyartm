I’m a sucker for good looking Flash sites, and Frederic Vavrille’s LivePlasma, based in France, is a great one. He’s mashed up the Amazon recommendation API for music and movies to visually show the relationship between bands/artists/movies. The results are very relevant and there are links to purchase anything you see that you want. Thanks Alarm Clock for pointing to this.
