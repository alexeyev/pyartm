TechCrunch is two months old today. To celebrate, I thought we’d reveal our RSS Aggregator market share breakdown. Our numbers are much different than those published by Pheedo and Feedburner. The main difference is Pluck has surged way, way ahead – are others seeing this trend as well? FeedBurner Stats: FeedBurner Statistics – Top 5 (July 2005) (removing 10 most popular feeds): Bloglines — 19.49% NetNewsWire — 10.07% iTunes — 9.53% Firefox Live Bookmarks — 7.25% iPodder — 7.17% Pheedo Stats: Pheedo Statistics – Top 5: Consistent with other RSS aggregator market share reports on the Internet, Pheedo is seeing Bloglines atop our feed reader statistics, followed by Firefox, Thunderbird, NewsGator and Sharpreader. In aggregate, these readers are used by almost 70 percent of people subscribing to Pheedo managed RSS content. TechCrunch Stats: Compare this to TechCrunch readership (about 1,000 feed readers over last 24 hours): TechCrunch’s Top 6: Pluck – 31.4% Bloglines – 24.8% NetNewsWire – 7.1% NewsGator Online – 5.0% Feeddemon – 4.0% SharpReader – 3.5% Pluck is clearly the no. 1 aggregator for TechCrunch readers. Are other bloggers seeing this surge by Pluck?
