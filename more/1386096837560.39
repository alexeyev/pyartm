Steve Rubel’s “Ten Technorati Hacks” is outstanding. If you are looking to exploit the deeper features of Technorati, read his post. My favorite features: Suscribe to Tag Feeds: Every technorati tag has its own feed Subscribe to Search Feeds: Every search has its own feed. Individual Blog Search: Click on the search tab and then enter the unique blog URL you want to search. Brower and OS plugings: Mac OS widgets and Firefox plugins I’ve been spending a lot of time on Technorati lately. They are doing a much better job indexing blogs quickly and in general posts are appearing in near real-time. Yahoo, Google, Topix and many others have launched blog search to try to knock Technorati out of its top position in real time search. None have succeeded so far, and Technorati’s recent full boolean search feature for tags shows that they are committed to innovating.
