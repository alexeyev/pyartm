Fruitcast launched today. It’s a service that automatically inserts 15 second sound advertisements directly into a publsiher’s podcast (either at the beginning, or the end, or both). They’ve focused on keeping things ultra simple. You simply publish your podcast through a feed they create for you, and the advertisements are auto-inserted. They already have a couple of blogs signed up for the service. It looks like they are paying out on a per-download basis, and the site suggests that podcasters can expect to receive $0.25 per listener. That’s a hefty $250 CPM to the advertiser…which is way above what radio stations charge for ads. Fruitcast was created by James Archer’s Forty Media in Mesa, Arizona.
