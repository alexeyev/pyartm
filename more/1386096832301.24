Frank Warren the creator of the increasingly popular postsecret website is now coming out with a book entitled PostSecret : Extraordinary Confessions from Ordinary Lives. The PostSecret book is a hardcover with 288 pages published by Harper Collins/Regan Books. Inside, there are hundreds of color images of postcards. Many of the PostSecrets have never been seen before. Postsecret has been a favorite site of mine. I wrote about it back in July (getting their permission to post more than a single image). Thousands of people have sent postcards that tell a secret fear, regret, hope, fantasty, betrayal, confession, hope or experience. Some of them are touching to the point of incredible sadness or elation. The site is wonderful. The rules? “Reveal anything – as long as it is true and you have never shared it with anyone before”.
