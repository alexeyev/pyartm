Ojos, which never owned ojos.com (they used ojos-inc.com) has found a permanent name – Riya. More on this on the Munjal Shah’s blog and Tara Hunt’s blog. Riya has a facial and text recognition technology that automatically tags photos with who’s in them. We profiled them earlier. Riya is preparing to start their private alpha and will hopefull launch within a couple of months. If you are interested in participating in the alpha, email alpha@riya.com. During the alpha they will only support IE6.
