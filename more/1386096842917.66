It certainly isn’t the much anticipated Google Music Store, but today Google started to incorporate music information into normal google search results in the same way they incorporate movie and stock information. If Google recognizes the band, album or song, they will put results at the top of search. Now you can search for a popular artist name, like the Beatles or the Pixies, and often Google will show some information about that artist, like cover art, reviews, and links to stores where you can download the track or buy a CD via a link at the top of your web search results page. Om says he found lots of obscure music, but my favorite band from college isn’t included. Google is currently linking to iTunes, Rhapsody and others to purchase music as well as reviews from select sites on the web. This is, of course, a good first step in putting together a music store. Let’s see where they go with this.
