If you take everything good about blogging and web 2.0 and chuck it out the window, and then add back in everything that is wrong with traditional marketing, you’d end up with the Juicy Fruit blog. I agree with Heather Green – it’s a train wreck. I am posting about it here because companies need to be ridiculed for creating crap like this. Juicy Fruit’s entire marketing department should be taken outside and beaten for spending shareholder money in this way.
