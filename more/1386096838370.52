We reached a new milestone in our ongoing experiment to see how many people can fit inside my house before the police come and arrest me: over 250 last night (previous record was 200ish) at the Riya Launch Party. The thing I liked best about this party was that Tara Hunt from Riya and Andrea Reinhardt from Just Starting Up took care of everything – Fifty something pizzas, 20 or more cases of beer, wine and champagne, bags and bags of ice, the A/V system for the demo and tons of tshirts and stickers. Tom Conrad from Pandora chipped in with a complete music system. And it was a great crowd. My pictures from the event are here. Here’s everyone’s tagged “TechcrunchMeetup4“. The rumors about a Google acquistion were neither confimed nor denied by anyone in the know…but there sure is a lot of buzz around this company right now. Things I loved about the event: Riya rocks and now even more people know about it My Dad flew in for the party and saw what this web 2.0 stuff is all about (on left in picture) My dog Laguna is still alive As far as I know, Dorrian didn’t park in my yard this time Lots of cool companies besides Riya came and showed their stuff in the demo room Things that weren’t as great about the event: Fifty something empty pizza boxes and 20 something cases of empty beer and wine bottles scattered around my lawn this morning Somebody drank all of my scotch again The Atherton police set up a sobriety checkpoint around the corner from my house Gabe, Richard, Fred and others were out of town and couldn’t make it That’s it for parties this year. The next one should be in January or February. I can’t say what it is yet but I will say that it involves a launch party again…this time for a book.
