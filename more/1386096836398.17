CollectiveX, a new venture backed by serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist Clarence Wooten, has put up a landing page and is taking requests for people interested in taking part in their early 2006 beta. I’ve known Clarence for years (I used to be his attorney), and I’ve heard his ideas for CollectiveX. It’s going to be an awesome web application for communicating with and managing your relationships with groups of people that you are affiliated with.
