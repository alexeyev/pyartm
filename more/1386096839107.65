Joyce Park’s Renkoo looks interesting. The Renkoo blog give a number of interesting feature hints. It looks to be an event/calendaring application, but it seems to include chat and other features as well. It is the goal of Renkoo to help people plan and remember and share peak experiences. and The Renkoo’s application interface intentionally blurs the lines between “webby”, desktop, and instant messaging. Anyone out there beta testing Renkoo and care to comment?
