UPDATE: I just saw this link to Sidebar at Google’s site. Thanks Fred! The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Google will release a new product tomorrow called “Sidebar”. As far as I can tell the product is not available at Google yet (as of 10:00 PM PST on Sunday). The WSJ reports that Sidebar will be available on Monday and will provide information including email, weather, stocks, and desktop search alongside whatever content users are viewing. It appears that Sidebar will self-customize based on user activities and will also include a text editor that allows users to write and store text files.
