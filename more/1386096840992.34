I’ve been testing out ajchat tonight with Brian Benzinger (a fellow web 2.0 workgroup member). Like Meebo, Gtalk and e-messenger.net, ajchat is an ajax instant messaging on the fly, that allows you to log in or type anonymously. It’s free. The ajchat blog is here. At this point, it appears that all chat sessions are public and linked from the home page. There is also an option to share a chat directly on a webpage, and against my better judgement that is exactly what I am going to do here. If it works, it will appear below. This to me, is a compelling feature that starts to encroach on some of the stuff that Userplane is doing. UPDATE: I took down the chat box. The entire site went down shortly after I put it up. It was nice while it lasted, though. UPDATE: Ok, the ajchat site is back up, but very unstable. Trying this again because, frankly, it rocks. UPDATE: It broke again. Took it down. It looks like their hosting service killed them. For those of you who didn’t see it, really, it was very cool.
