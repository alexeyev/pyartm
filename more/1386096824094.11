We just heard about a new online calendar application called Hula that’s ajax-based. It hasn’t launched and we can’t find the website for it, but some bloggers are linking to a couple of flash movies that show it in action. This reminds us of Apple’s iCal. The power of Ajax to make web apps work like desktop apps is awesome. I just hope it’s cheaper than Trumba, which is charging $40/year. First Movie Second Movie Update: Thanks to Ross in the comments area, we now have a link to Hula. “Hula is a calendar and mail server whose goal is to be fun and easy to use, while scaling effortlessly from small groups to large organizations with thousands of members. Hula is an open source project led by Novell.”
