I recently spoke with one of the founders of Sponit, a new service that will be launching in the next month or so. Sponit, which is being created by three U.C. Berkeley students, is an innovative new group “blogging” platform that is quite addictive. As I’ve said before, I’m a sucker for the closed-beta, give-us-your-email page. But I’ve also had the chance to test sponit. It’s still in the very early stages, but its an interesting application and adds to the overall web 2.0 discussion.
