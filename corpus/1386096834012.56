Everything is all set for tonight’s party and we’ve very quietly re-opened the wiki to attendees. It also looks like we’ll have 50+ people participating remotely via festoon. We will be having demos from 6 pm to about 10:30, starting with the first public look at Sphere At 7, we’ll take a break and have sponsor speeches and a keynote by Dave Winer. His preparation notes are here.
