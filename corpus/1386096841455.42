Toronto-based online photo sharing BubbleShare is just wonderful, and ridiculously easy to use. Their interface team deserves a gold star or something, because I don’t think I’ve ever used a site’s full functionality without consulting a single FAQ or other instruction. BubbleShare allows users to upload photos without registration (this isn’t really a trick either – later registration is absolutely bare bones). There is a tour linked from the home page, but you really don’t need it – just start uploading photos and you’ll get how it works (they use the Flash 8 upload feature for photo sharing). Things are album based. The free service allows users to create albums of up to 100 photos each, with a permanent URL for sharing. Photos can be dragged and dropped to change the order, resized and a voice comment can be added. Comments are available for visitors as well as an RSS feed. Another key BubbleShare feature that many photo sites don’t have is a multi-uploader tool that allows user to upload many photos at once. The only thing that BubbleShare is missing is photo tagging and tag search. BubbleShare is now my second-favorite Canadian web 2.0 company. Brian Benzinger has more.
