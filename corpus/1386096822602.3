Company: Simpy Launched: May 4, 2004 What is it? Simpy is a social bookmarking service that can be compared to del.icio.us, Furl Yahoo My Web 2.0 and others. In their own words, “Simpy is a social bookmarking service. With Simpy, you can save, tag and search your own bookmarks and notes or browse and search other users’ links and tags. You can be open and share your links with others, or keep them private. Simpy also helps you find like-minded people, discover new and interesting sites, publish your bookmarks, detect and eliminate link-rot, etc.” Link Simpy has an excellent user interface and interesting features that the competitors haven’t added. Cool features include full text search of pages (Furl has this as well) and also the ability to find broken links and fix them. We also like the ability to have private, searchable, taggable free text notes on any page. Any bookmark can also be made private. Finally, the ability to add a simpy search box on your blog or other web page (to search your tags) is great. Core Features: - Save and Tag pages with a single click using the Simpy Bookmarklet - Full-text Search bookmarked pages’ content, not just meta-data - Attach searchable notes to bookmarks - Choose between private or public bookmarks - Find people like you and subscribe to their bookmarks - Share your bookmarks with others - Detect broken, forgotten and even redirected bookmarks - Upload your existing bookmarks (Firefox, Mozilla, Netscape, Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera, Galeon and Konqueror supported) - Export your bookmarks - Access your bookmarks from any browser and multiple computers - Save private, taggable, and searchable free-text Notes - For hackers: Simpy has an open REST API – use it! - For bloggers: Publish your bookmarks in your blog using RSS or ATOM We’ve spoken with Otis GospodnetiÄ‡ by email over the last couple of weeks and have been told that Simpy will be releasing new features sometime this week. We look forward to seeing what’s coming! In general, we find Simpy’s user interface and search capabilities superior to del.icio.us and Furl. We like the interface for adding bookmarks, and ask only that pages can be bookmarked via a popup like del.icio.us (as an option). The optional additional metadata fields are really useful.
