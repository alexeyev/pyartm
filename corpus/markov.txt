In the domain of physics and probability, a Markov random field (often abbreviated as MRF),
Markov network or undirected graphical model is a set of random variables having a Markov property
described by an undirected graph. A Markov random field is similar to a Bayesian network in its
representation of dependencies; the differences being that Bayesian networks are directed and acyclic,
 whereas Markov networks are undirected and may be cyclic. Thus, a Markov network can represent certain
 dependencies that a Bayesian network cannot (such as cyclic dependencies); on the other hand, it can't
 represent certain dependencies that a Bayesian network can (such as induced dependencies).

When the probability distribution is strictly positive, it is also referred to as a Gibbs random field,
 because, according to the Hammersleyâ€“Clifford theorem, it can then be represented by a Gibbs measure.
  The prototypical Markov random field is the Ising model; indeed, the Markov random field was introduced
  as the general setting for the Ising model.[1] In the domain of artificial intelligence, a Markov random
  field is used to model various low- to mid-level tasks in image processing and computer vision.[2]
  For example, MRFs are used for image restoration, image completion, segmentation, image registration,
  texture synthesis, super-resolution, stereo matching and information retrieval.
