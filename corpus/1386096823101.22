Pluck made TechCrunch a “featured feed” today (Link). For new subscribers (and there have been a bunch – thanks Pluck), we apologize for the slow review day today. We are still recovering from the AlwaysOn conference. Tomorrow’s weekly wrapup will be a great one, though, and we have a ton of great reviews coming up! For those of you looking for the best RSS aggregator on the market, check out Pluck’s new Firefox extension (our profile). And Shadows (our profile), their brand new bookmarking service with the awesome shadow pages functionality was definitely the buzz at AlwaysOn. Thanks Pluck!
