PodDater, which launched on November 16, is a video dating site with tagging that focuses on allowing members to download videos of people they are interested in to their iPod. The service is free and allows searching by tag, gender and zip code. It seems like adding an RSS feed for a search is an obvious feature to add, but itâ€™s not there yet. PodDater follows Consumating as an early dating site adopter of tagging.
