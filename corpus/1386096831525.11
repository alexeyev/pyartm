I came across two very funny web 2.0 satires today. Web Two Point Oh! is a site that will generate “a pre-created VC friendly Web 2.0 company just for you!”. My company is “zVodidoo” and my product is “rss-based collaborative document editing via ajax”. I like Richard‘s too – Blinonorati, a “tag-based wiki via flash”. And Russell Beattie finally categorizes all of these new companies in an intelligent way. “Scrape Engines” kills me. I love that some of the comments seem quite offended.
