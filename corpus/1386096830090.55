I’ve come accross a couple of free Wiki solutions lately and thought I’d post them here. Check out PBWiki and Ben Nolan’s Foopad if you’re looking for a bare bones and free Wiki solution. PBwiki also has very nice privacy features, so you can make a wiki public or private, and turn on or off editing credentials for individuals.
