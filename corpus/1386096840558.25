Meetro, an interesting location-based instant messaging client thatâ€™s compatible with AOL, ICQ, MSN and Yahoo!, is now alpha testing a Mac version of their software. I profiled Meetro originally in August, If you are a Mac user and want to try Meetro, email mac@meetro.com and include your city, state (if applicable) and country of residence.
