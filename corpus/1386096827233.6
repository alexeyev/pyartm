I wasn’t going to write about PocketMod, and I know people are going to give me crap about it, but I keep seeing posts on it and so I finally tried it out. Other than the fact that folding the paper correctly (see screen shot below) is harder than tying a bow tie, there are one or two things I like about it. But I get ahead of myself. For those of you who don’t know, PocketMod is a flash program that allows you to print modules on a piece of paper, so that you can refer to it and take notes on it later. There are calendars, to do lists, tic-tac-toe, etc. You can up up to eight modules on a page and it folds into a nice little book. I do a lot of actual writing during the day to keep organized. At any given time I have 3-4 pieces of paper in my pocket with notes on product ideas, new companies to profile, etc. So I guess I may start to use this. Especially now that I’ve invested so much time in learning how to fold it properly. There isn’t a whole lot else to say about PocketMod. I’ve put the folding instructions below just because I think it’s hilarious that you have to cut and fold the damn thing. This is supposed to be a blog about web 2.0.
