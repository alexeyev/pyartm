Editor’s Note: Yes, I know Flickr is not a newly launched web 2.0 company and in fact it is now part of Yahoo. However, I’m the editor so I can write about whatever I want. And besides, I needed to put something up to move the etamp post down – people are complaining. And believe it or not, some of our readers have requested things like “can you explain this flickr thing?” Company: Flickr Status: Acquired by Yahoo in March 2005 – Link What is it? Flickr is one of the defining web 2.0 applications. You can upload photos. Lots of services do that. But what Flickr did as well was to allow sharing and tagging of photos, allowing for rich networking and sharing of pictures and, more importantly, experiences. And, Flickr has the critical mass to have a massive network effect. In their own words, “Flickr is a revolution in photo storage, sharing and organization, making photo management an easy, natural and collaborative process. Get comments, notes, and tags on your photos, post to any blog, share and chat live and more!” Flickr is also free, and easy to use. Features: - 20 megs of free uploads per month (unlimited for pro account – $25/year) - easy posting to blogs (just need to authenticate your blog first) - post by email (great for camera phones!) - sharing, public and private - new option to have pictures printed - easy tagging of pictures, your friends can also tag your pictures - easy uploading tools - RSS feeds for everything - tool for mass-organizing photos - pro account is also ad-free Screen Shots: Relevant Links: Press/major media reviews FAQs Flickr blog Technorati tag: flickr Delicious tag: flickr BBC on Flickr QuickOnlineTips on Flickr Acquisition The Great Flickr Tools Collection (updated regularly)
