WSFinder is a wiki that provides information on existing open APIs and web services. It launched today and badly needs a logo. Chris Law, one of the early employees of Tribe and creator of WSFinder, writes: We are up I’ve been scouring the web for some time trying to compile an initial list of APIs that people could use to create applications with and now that we’re up to over 80. I think it’s pretty cool. It’s our hope that you find this resource useful and that it inspires you to create some cool applications using these Web Services. Please let us know once you do create them and we’ll add them to the examples pages. Or just add to the wiki yourself! We also hope that this effort will encourage more companies and developers will open up their APIs and let other people have access to them. We’ve seen many examples of great new things that have been created using open APIs that no one would have anticipated before. A burst of cool new services is emerging and we want to help accelerate that process. This blog is going to be used to talk about what is going with the WSFinder Wiki as well as interesting thoughts we have on Web 2.0 and Web Services in general. Drop us a line and let us know what you think! I’m at chrislaw(at)gmail(dot)com You can get back to the WSFinder Wiki here at http://www.wsfinder.com Chris I love Wikis and the things people do with them. Examples are everywhere, and new niche wikis (this one for ICANN) are popping up constantly. WSFinder will be particularly interesting for those of us who are building new companies and want a single resource for APIs to assist with mashups.
