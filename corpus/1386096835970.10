Microsoft will be beta launching a new web 2.0 service under the Live.com brand in the next few weeks. The final name is TDB, but the current project name is “Fremont” and the URL fremont.live.com will redirect once its fully live. I had a chance to see a demo of the product – it’s very cool and will definitely shake things up.
