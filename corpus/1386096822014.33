Service: Del.icio.us Direc.tor Launched: June 22, 2005 What is it? del.icio.us direc.tor is an Ajax client-side bookmarklet application that, in the words of LifeHacker, “turns the Del.icio.us bookmark service into a gorgeous, lively, dynamic application that just about popped the eyeballs right out of my head.” From the site: “It leverages the XML and XSL services of modern browsers to deliver a responsive interface for managing user accounts with a large number of records. The main features are: * In-browser handling of del.icio.us bookmarks (tested up to 12,000 records) * Find-as-you-type searching of all your bookmarks, with basic search operators * Sort by description, tags, or timestamp * Ad-hoc tag browser” Link It is easy to install and is a wonderful interface for Delicious.
