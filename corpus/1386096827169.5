Findory has a first-class personalization engine for blog and other news (see our profile on September 3, 2005). Findory has built up a loyal following in the nearly two years since its launch. However, many users requested the ability to include RSS feeds of their choice directly into their blog and news channels. Greg and Alex just added this functionality, making Findory nearly perfect as a news source and reader. Findory users now have the ability to add feeds directly into Findory – one at a time, via an OPML cut-and-paste or simply by directly importing your feeds from Bloglines, if that is your current reader. You can also import other users’ public Bloglines feeds. Once you’ve imported these feeds, the powerful Findory personalization engine takes over and presents posts to you in a personalized way, based on what you (and community members like you) tend to find interesting. Click on TechCrunch posts a lot, and you’ll start to see lots of new posts from TechCrunch and other blogs on new web 2.0 companies. Findory is squarely attacking the current efforts by Attensa, SearchFox, Personal Bee and others to present your feed information in a more intelligent and useful way. The standard readers quite simply don’t work for power users with 100+ feeds any more – and companies are trying very hard to find ways of sorting through this information for you before you start to read. And unlike Attensa (who hasn’t launched their personalization product yet) and SearchFox (in private beta, although you can get an invite fairly easily), Findory is live and open to everyone. Findory does not support folders, so if you tend to group your feeds that way Findory will not work well for you. If you methodically check your feeds and like knowing what order they are in, you may want to stick to your current reader. But it is very fast, and does group informaiton well according to interests. Additional Reading Inside Google, SEW, BlogHerald, Threadwatch, New Media Hack, RSS Compendium Blog
