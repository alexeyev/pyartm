Big news at Feedster. Mitsui & Co., Ltd. made an investment (size undisclosed) in Feedster today. â€œWe are pleased to have Mitsui as an investor,” says Chris Redlitz, Feedsterâ€™s Vice President, Sales and Marketing. â€œFeedster is already a market leader in blog search and content syndication. With this investment we continue to distance ourselves from the field and prepare for global expansion.” The Feedster PR quote was from Chris Redlitz, VP Sales & Marketing, not Scott Rafer, the CEO. That should have given everyone a clue as to the next piece of news, which followed a couple of hours later. Scott is stepping down as CEO and the Feedster board is searching for his replacement. Scott is not wasting any time in starting something new – he became chairman of startup Wireless Ink today. Scott, you created one of the founding pillars of web 2.0 and we salute you. Good luck with your travels and your new venture. No news on the new feature rumor from yesterday.
