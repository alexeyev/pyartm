Company: Connexion by Boeing What is it? It’s high speed internet access in the sky. I just posted a profile of a new skype tool and did it all sitting here on an SAS flight from Seattle to Copenhagen (heading to the ICANN conference in Luxembourg next week). The technology for this has been around for a few years, but this is my first experience using it. I’m skype-outing at $0.02 per minute, gizmo’ing, IMing with people, uploading and downloading like crazy, and generally making a nuisance of myself to everyone around me. Pricing is $30 for the entire trip. What a wonderful productivity tool for long flights while we research, use and write about new web2.0 services!
