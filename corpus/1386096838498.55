If you are interested in meeting the founders of four of the search engines I’ve profiled here at Techcrunch – Truveo, Trulia, SimplyHired and Healthline, make sure you show up for this event on Thursday, November 10. Cost? $15. Location? Microsoft Mountain View offices. Register now because the event only holds 270 people. Then carpool with me up to the Pandora party in San Francisco (rsvp for that on the blog post linked).
