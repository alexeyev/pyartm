After the success of our first meetup and bbq in Atherton last Thursday, we’re doing it again this week. About 25 people showed up last week, and we expect quite a few more this week. If you are in the bay area, please join us. The event is being held at our house/office in Atherton. A Wiki for the event is here and includes specifics and directions. If you are coming, please add your name to the bottom of the wiki. If you don’t know how to edit a wiki, you can’t come. We’ll be bbq’ing from 5-6:30, and will have plenty of wine, beer and soft drinks throughout the evening. Computers for demo’ing products are avaiable in the living room and in a back office. Fire pit is outside to keep things going late into the evening. If you’re looking to meet other entrepreneurs and VCs, or want to get the buzz started on your startup, this is the place to be (if you aren’t at DEMO, that is).
