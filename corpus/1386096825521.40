I just heard a very juicy rumor (some stuff already on Technorati about this) that Adaptive Path is coming out with a very cool new Ajax application called Measure Map. The site is taking registration requests now. People who are participating in the alpha are drooling. It’s apparently a blog analytics tool that crushes everything else out there. I also heard a few other things about it but am sworn to secrecy. I’m looking forward to seeing this first hand.
