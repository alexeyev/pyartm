Company: FeedShake Launched: July 21, 2005 (estimated) What is it? FeedShake is a website that creates a single RSS feed from multiple RSS feeds. You can also filter out posts that contain specified keywords, and/or filter in posts only if they contain specified keywords. The site is incredibly easy to use (it takes mere moments to create an aggregated feed) and no registration or email address is required. Similar services are listed by libary clips here. According to Library Clips, “Actually this tool is quite unique as it is the first to do both splicing and filteringâ€¦there are many blending tools, but ReFilter seems to be the only standalone filtering toolâ€¦here are other general filtering tools.” (Link) The feed is auto-named “FeedShake” but can of course be renamed in your reader to whatever you want. It would be nice to be able to auto-rename the feed when it’s created so that other users would have the title you selected. Other current limitations: “This service is beta. Currently it supports RSS 2.0 feeds” We’d be happy to pay for naming and stats on the feed. We tested the service by burning a combined feed of TechCrunch and EarningsCast, another Archimedes blog. The feed is: http://www.feedshake.com/feed.php?code=wc5mjf0wz4. The feed works great. Awesome service. We love it.
