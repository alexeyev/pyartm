Company: Protopage Launched: May 15, 2005 Location: London Overview: Virtual desktops are in vogue this week. Unlike Goowy (profiled yesterday), which is flash based, Protopage is all Ajax, baby. Visually is is both functional and beautiful. Drag, drop, add, and delete. Totally cool. Applications are somewhat limited for now: sticky notes, to-dolists, favorite links and quick searches. Also, the initial start page is a bit crowded, although it took only a few minutes to customize it. I imagine they’ll have RSS, email and other cool widgets added soon – more are definitely needed. What’s the business model? No idea. It’s totally free and sans-ads, at least for now. No registration at all is required to use it, although to name the page you need to go through an email verification. Check it out.
