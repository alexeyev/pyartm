eBay announced the acquisition of Skype (previous profiles) for $4.1 billion today. $2.6 billion is being paid up front – half cash and half eBay shares. Another $1.5 billion will be paid in 2008 or later based on performance goals. Skype has 50 million registered users and about $7 million in revenue last year. This year’s revenue is projected to be $60 million. Jeff Clavier has an excellent early analysis of the deal.
