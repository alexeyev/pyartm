I first heard about Browsr in a comment to one of my posts. In some ways itâ€™s a standard bookmarking site, but at this point lacks most of the advanced features of Del.icio.us, Shadows, Wink, etc. But Browsr does have one feature that is interesting. Bookmarks are categorized, and others can rate the usefullness of the bookmark. Browsr then creates a home page directory of the most popular categories and the highest ranked bookmarks within each category. The result is a very nice directory. I like products that take aggregated user data and do something interesting with it. In an indirect way, this reminds me of memeorandum, digg and other useful services that do the same. User date + algorithms (even simple stuff like this) can be incredibly useful.
