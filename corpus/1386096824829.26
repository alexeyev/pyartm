Company: Indeed Previous Profile: August 4, 2005 Location: Stamford CT Indeed raised $5 million from the New York Times, Union Square Ventres and Allen & Company. This comes on the heals of Simply Hired’s $3m raise last week (Profile). Congratulations Indeed! The money aside, a strategic partnership with the NYT is absolutely tremendous. Having access to Union Square Ventures (Fred Wilson and Brad Burnham) and Allen & Co. is also worth more than the money they’ve raised. This really is very important news. My bet is the Simply Hired guys are not enjoying their day. The New York Times Company Acquires Interest in Indeed, Inc.
