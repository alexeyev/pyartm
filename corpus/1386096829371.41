Company: zvents Launched: next week Location: Menlo Park, CA I had a chance to see a demo of the upcoming Zvents service this evening at the NetService Ventures Group office on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park. Mark this one down as an ajax showcase. Zvents is a complete events ecosystem, with search, event creation, calendaring, sharing and blogging/webmaster tools (lots of ajax here) for promotion of events and calendars. It looks similar in many respects to EVDB (now eventful), although the search functionality is clearly a generation further along and it certainly is a very good looking site. zvents opens up next week and will be launching at the Web 2.0 Conference. Peter Caputa wrote a detailed analysis of this space, including eventful and zvents, on PC4Media.
