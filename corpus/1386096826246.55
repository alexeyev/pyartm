Website: Best Page in the Universe Note: This is a humorous site, not a serious profile. If you are easily offended, do not click the link. What is it? This website is very, very funny. I’m not allowed to make normal postings today because Fred is still working on the site and he’s demanded that (i) I start using Photoshop for images, and (ii) I write only “standards based postings”. So in the meantime I though I’d profile “The Best Page in the Universe”, a very funny site. My favorite page is his one on blogging. It’s funny, and I have to admit being guilty of many of the things he points out. “Blogger: Term used to describe anyone with enough time or narcissism to document every tedious bit of minutia filling their uneventful lives. Possibly the most annoying thing about bloggers is the sense of self-importance they get after even the most modest of publicity. Sometimes it takes as little as a referral on a more popular blogger’s website to set the lesser blogger’s ego into orbit. Then God forbid a blogger gets mentioned on CNN. If you thought it was impossible for a certain blogger to get more pious than he was, wait until you see the shit storm of self-righteous save-the-world bullshit after a network plug. Suddenly the boring, mild-mannered blogger you once knew will turn into Mother Theresa, and will single handedly take it upon himself to end world hunger with his stupid links to band websites and other smug blogger dipshits.”
