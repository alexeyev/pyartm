TechCrunch has hit a milestone, and is celebrating with a makeover. We grew to over 500 daily RSS readers yesterday (about six weeks after our initial launch). People seem to like our content and until now have overlooked our fairly pathetic design skills. Well, today that changes! We hired all-star developer and web designer Frederico Oliveira to redesign TechCrunch from the ground up. All of the bells and whistles should be finished in a day or two, but the general look and feel is now complete. Love it? Hate it? Let us know. Fred will also be posting occasionally at TechCrunch. Heâ€™s opinionated, smart and has an awesome writing style. See his blog at webreakstuff.com. Welcome Fred!
